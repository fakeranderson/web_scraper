# web_scraper

Quick way to generate the last 7 days' PS4 releases. Written for CLS Sacred Symbols so Chris Maldonado can finally stop doing his bad Justin Roiland impression when making up game descriptions. Josh Eckroth did most of the clojure web scraping work, while I did the easy stuff.

## Usage

Open the standalone folder. If on Windows just double-click GenerateTitles.bat, or if on a good operating system just run GenerateTitles.sh, then a file with the goods called "title_descriptions.txt" will appear shortly in the same directory. There's some junk still in there, but this should be enough to end this nightmare.
